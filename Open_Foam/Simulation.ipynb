    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to set the CFD simulation up. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest in the end of the tutorial, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**0. Import the CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously generated CFD domain, fully explained in the Domain section, will be imported properly into the CFD solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **3D Laminar flow in a circular pipe** are explained in great details. The bases and foundation of this case study is case study of **2D Laminar flow in a rectangular pipe**. Hence, the body of this tutorial is similar to the corresponding case study, with differences going from 2D to 3D. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">OpenFoam/run/tutorials</span>. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **3D Laminar Flow in a circular pipe** the tutorial of **2D over an airfoil** located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">OpenFoam/run/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D</span> is used. The reason behind choosing this tutorial for the current problem is that it is setup to simulate a steady state and incompressible flow. Furthermore, majority of the required boundary conditions for the current tutorial are similar to the required boundary conditions for our problem of interest. Hence, using the previously developed OpenFoam configuration files for the tutorial, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development can be done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0. Importing the Created CFD Domain into Solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The official mesh generator for OpenFoam is called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This is a command base mesher software. Users write/edit the desired settings to generate and discretize the geometry of CFD domain in a dictionary file (i.e. a text file) named <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMeshDict</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant\\polyMesh</span> inside the main working directory. In simple words the file is the dictionary, where the geometry and discretization process of it are fully defined. Once edits of `blockMeshDict` file are completed then it is compiled via the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">blockMesh</span>. This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam solver in the directory of the `blockMeshDict` file. Readers can read more about the `blockMesh` utility [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/blockmesh/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, OpenFoam has various built-in commands that allow it's users to convert their previously generated CFD domain in different mesher packages into the readable format for the OpenFoam. A list of these commands can be found [here](http://www.openfoam.org/features/mesh-conversion.php). In this tutorial this alternative approach is used to convert the previously generated CFD domain with * .msh format to the readable format in OpenFoam. In order to perform this process users put the * .msh file of the previously generated CFD domain in the main working directory and use the command <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluent3DMeshToFoam</span> with the name of the 3D mesh file after the command to perform the mesh conversion process (i.e. <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fluent3DMeshtoFoam [file name]. msh</span>). This will generate multiple required files, that include the details of the discretized CFD domain for the use of OpenFoam in the working directory. Users should make sure that the generated report contains no error or problem. The details of the previously generated CFD domain in * .msh format are fully explained in the Domain (see <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Common_Files -> Domain</span>) part of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the classical problem of a three dimensional flow in a circular pipe is that the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fvSchemes</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\system</span> folder. To set the solver to be steady users define <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">steadyState</span> for the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">ddtSchemes</span> and the rest of the settings will remain unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         steadyState;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time the Transient model should be chosen in this step. Various available time schemes along with other implementable option within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">fvSchemes</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current problem the focus is to investigate laminar flow evolution inside the pipe and formation/effects of the laminar boundary layer at the pipe's walls as a uniform flow enter a vertical circular pipe. Within the simpleFoam solver in OpenFoam version 3.0+ there is no command to set the viscous model to be laminar. Users can instead turn the turbulence model off. This modification will simulate the flow set the Reynolds stress terms to zero and simulate the flow to be laminar. This modification is set in a dictionary file called <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">turbulencePropertise</span> located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant</span> folder:\n",
    "\n",

    "turbulence      off;\n",
    "\n",
    "printCoeffs     off;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the critical Reynolds number, based on the paper by Osborn Reynolds is 2300, when the regime of the flow transitions from laminar to turbulent. In case studies with Reynolds number higher than the corresponding critical values the appropriate turbulence model should be selected at this step. Various available turbulence models along with other options within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">RASPropertise</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/turbulence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainties in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">transportPropertise</span> located in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant</span> folder. In this file the material is set to be <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">Newtonian</span> fluid with a defined density rho ($\\rho$) kinematic viscosity nu ($\\nu$). It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "rho            [ 1 -3 0 0 0 0 0 ] 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu             [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 0.01;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reynolds number of the pipe flow is defined as $Re=\\frac{\\rho V D_h}{\\mu}=\\frac{V D_h}{\\nu}$. In this equation $V$ is the free stream velocity of the flow and $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter that can be estimated as the diameter of the pipe. Considering that the pipe's width is 0.1 [m], to match a desired Reynolds number of this flow based on th eabove equation, user can define the value of nu ($\\nu$) to 0.1 so that the flow's Reynolds number will be equal to the value of the flow free stream velocity $V$. Therefore, changing the value of $V$ value would set the nominal Reynolds number of the flow. For other cases users should define the working fluid via similar process as well. Various available transport models along with other options within <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">transportPropertise</span> dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">boundary</span> file located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">\\constant\\polyMesh</span>. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize it, the boundary file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">U</span> and pressure <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">p</span>, at these boundaries are set in <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">U</span> and <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">p</span> files located at <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0</span> folder located in the working directory respectively. The <span style=style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\">0</span> folder includes the values of the field variables at boundaries for the time t=0.\n",
    "As discussed earlier in the CFD domain's creation and discretization section, the CFD domain has three faces as boundaries. The boundary and zone conditions settings to develop CFD simulation for 3D Laminar flow in a circular pipe case in OpenFoam are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inlet:** The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity and uniform atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure).

Set the type of face to patch, which is a condition that contains no geometric or topological information about the mesh:\n",
